# Components for the Volusion Element platform

The components in this repository are injected by default into all Element blocks. This lets users
configure their components globally across all theme pages.


## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
```

Open up the component's `index.html` in any browser. 

To add a new component, simply drop a new folder in the `src` directory with the desired name, and use
the existing components as a guide.
